        <td>Machine language</td>
        <td>Programs for modern computers consist of sequences of instructions that are encoded as numeric digits. Such an encoding system is known as a machine language.</td>

        <td>Debugging</td>
        <td>Locates and corrects errors in programs.</td>

        <td>Assembler</td>
        <td>Once such a mnemonic system was established, programs called assemblers were developed to convert mnemonic expressions into machine language instructions.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Assembly language</td>
        <td>A mnemonic system for representing programs.</td>

        <td>Translation programs are often called compilers.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Interpreter</td>
        <td>An alternative to translators, called interpreters, emerged as another means of implementing third-generation languages. These programs were similar to translators except that they executed the instructions as they were translated instead of recording the translated version for future use.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Cross-platform software</td>
        <td>Software that is independent of an operating system’s design as well as the machine’s hardware design and is therefore executable throughout a network.</td>

        <td>Natural language</td>
        <td>(such as English, German, and Latin) are distinguished from formal languages (such as programming languages).</td>

        <td>Formal languages</td>
        <td>Programming languages which evolved over time without formal grammatical analysis.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Machine independence</td>
        <td>With the development of third-generation languages, the goal of machine independence was largely achieved. Since the statements in a third-generation language did not refer to the attributes of any particular machine, they could be compiled as easily for one machine as for another.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>High-level programming language</td>
        <td>High-level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.</td>

        <td>Scripting language</td>
        <td>A subset of the imperative programming languages is the collection of languages known as scripting languages. These languages are typically used to perform administrative tasks rather than to develop complex programs.</td>
