<h3><b>Facts of the Case:</b></h3>
<p>The Supreme Court case of Engel v. Vitale came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962. The case was brought up because The New York State Board of Regents authorized that students could have the choice to participate in a short and vague prayer at the beginning of each school day, following their recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
<p>This is how it went:</p>
<p>“Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country” (Heimler’s History).</p>
&nbsp;
<p>This prayer did not name any well-known deities such as Jesus or Allah (Heimler). Students were also given the option to opt out of participating through written permission from their parents.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Despite being an optional prayer, a group of parents, led by Stephen Engel, challenged the practice. Engel was a Jewish man and felt that the state was imposing a one-size-fits-all prayer upon children of many different faiths or of no faith at all.  The group challenging the prayer did so on the basis that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The New York Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Board of Regents, holding that the prayer did not violate the Constitution. In response, Engel appealed to the Supreme Court where the oral argument was held on April 3, 1962.</p>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Question of the Case:</b></h3>
<p><h2>Does the reading of a nondenominational prayer at the start of the school day violate the "establishment of religion" clause of the First Amendment? (Oyez)</h2></p>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Arguments:</b></h3>
<p>The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment states:</p>
<p>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion…”</p>
<p>It could be argued that Congress was not involved because it was a New York state case, so the prayer was not violating Engel’s First Amendment rights, which is meant to protect citizens from the federal government. </p>
<p>The 14th Amendment rebuttals this claim because it states that, “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States…” This connects the First Amendment to the states Heimler’s History). Therefore, it was still primarily a question of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. </p>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Decision:</b></h3>
<p>The case was decided on June 25, 1962, in a 6-1 decision. The Supreme Court held that the state cannot hold prayers in public schools, even if participation is not required and the prayer is not tied to any specific religion (Oyez).</p>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Majority Opinion:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Led by Justice Black.</li>
    <li>School-sponsored prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</li>
    <li>Allowing students to absent from the prayer did not make the law constitutional because the purpose of the First Amendment is to prevent the government from interfering with religion (United States Court).</li>
    <li>Because Americans adhere to a wide variety of beliefs, the government should not endorse any belief or religion.</li>
    <li>In the past, when the government got involved in religious affairs, wars, persecutions, and other destructive measures often arose.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Concurring Opinion:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>By Justice Douglas.</li>
    <li>Justice Douglas went even further to say that any type of public promotion of religion violates the Establishment Clause. This included giving financial aid to religious schools. </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Dissenting Opinion:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>By Justice Stewart.</li>
    <li>Justice Stewart argued that the Establishment Clause was only meant to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church, such as the Church of England. It was not meant to prohibit all types of government involvement with religion. </li>
    <li>He found that the nondenominational nature of the prayer and the “absentee” provision removed constitutional challenges (United States Courts).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Impact:</b></h3>
<p>Engel v. Vitale established that states cannot hold prayers in public schools, even if the prayer is voluntary and nondenominational (Ballotpedia).</p>
<p>The Engel v. Vitale decision has been used as a precedent case for several other cases. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Wallace v. Jaffree (1985): Alabama law invalidated - the law required a moment of silence which appeared like it was written specifically to encourage school prayer (The Free Speech Center). </li>
    <li>Lee v. Weisman (1992) – Invalidated a middle school graduation school prayer (The Free Speech Center). </li>
    <li>Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe (2000) – Invalidated prayer at high school football games (The Free Speech Center).</li>
