This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.</li>
                    <li>CSMA/CA Wifi - The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them. Such policies are classified as Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them. Such policies are classified as Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as WiFi.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Repeater - Little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals.</li>
                    <li>Bridge - Similar to, but more complex than, a repeater. Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection. Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing on the same side of a bridge can exchange messages without interfering with communication taking place on the other side. A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.</li>
                    <li>Switch - Essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel.</li>
                    <li>Router - The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.</li>
                    <li>Gateway - The “point” at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.</li>

Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer. From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they reach the transport layer at their final destination. It is quite possible for the packets related to a common message to follow different paths through the Internet.</li>
